    Most people here probably only run makepkg only to immediately install the package afterwards (then probably delete it). So it seems like a big waste of time to spend time compressing the package only to decompress it seconds later. Other people here might run a small repo or something that requires them to have a compressed package file, and they can benefit, too, by taking advantage of the parallelization introduced in recently-released xz 5.2.0.

    To skip compression, you'll want to make the following change to your /etc/makepkg.conf:

    [...]
    #PKGEXT='.pkg.tar.xz'
    PKGEXT='.pkg.tar'
    [...]

    (essentially removing ".xz" from $PKGEXT)

    To instead use multiple cores to compress, you're going to have to change the $COMPRESSXZ variable:

    [...]
    COMPRESSXZ=(xz -T 0 -c -z -)
    [...]

    (adding "-T 0" to the parameters)
